        <h2>
            It's not ordinary for people to travel especially if they have a lot
            of things to do back home. It's always useful to have piece of mind
            and clear vision of what to do with our life while we're young and
            free. Time management is the key to a successful life and without it
            we would have been lost in time. Below i will describe the reasons
            why travelling is very beneficial for you and your mental health.
        </h2>

        <li>Travel helps your brain function better and boosts creativity</li>

        <li>We rewire our brains and we have great state of mind</li>

        <li>
            We show more enthousiasm about life and we tend to be more
            optimistic than the average joe
        </li>

        <li>
            As you travel you're exposed to more new people, cultures, and
            lifestyles than you are living in your homeland all the time
        </li>
